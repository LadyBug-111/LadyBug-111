- 👋 Hi, I’m @LadyBug-111
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, AI, natural language processing, illustrating, art, design, philosophy, music, Buddhism, movies, and creating things from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science, blockchain technologies, how to stay organized, improve my communication skills, make great first impressions, and knitting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me Please don't reach out, as I'm still mastering how to respond to messages and communicate with human beings.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.
